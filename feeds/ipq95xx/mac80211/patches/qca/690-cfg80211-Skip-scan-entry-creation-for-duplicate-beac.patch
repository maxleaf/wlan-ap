Subject: [PATCH] cfg80211: Skip scan entry creation for duplicate beacon

An AP whose primary channel is non-PSC channel may transmit
duplicate beacon in PSC channel. To determine duplicate beacon
HE operation IE was used.

When validating the frequency, determined frequency was in KHZ
and chandef frequency was on MHZ resulting in false positives.

Also maximum operating bandwidth is 320MHz in 6GHz, hence difference
between operating frequency and PSC frequency can be more than 80Mhz.
Changed the condtion to meet the same.
